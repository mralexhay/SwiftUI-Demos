# SwiftUI-Demos

As I learn SwiftUI I'm adding generic interfaces I build to this repo as examples of different types of UIs that can be created and adapted.

The project is built for for iOS14+ 

So far it includes:

## Tagger
A simple interface for adding and removing tags to an array. It includes a useful tag list that dynamically flows elements onto new rows and error handling.

## Grouped List
An inset list that has a search field for filtering and a picker to choose between grouped & non-grouped list. Includes disclosure groups for hiding grouped content.

![A screenshot from an iPhone of an interface with a title that says "Personnel". Below the title is a picker between "Staff" and "Departments". Below this is a text field and a filtered list of staff, grouped by their department](https://i.imgur.com/rMEPGc1.png "Grouped List SwiftUI Interface")

## Toast
A notification view that is temporarily displayed on top of the UI.

Below that is a button that says copy text and at the bottom of the screen is a grey notification window that has a check mark and text saying "copied to clipboard"](https://i.imgur.com/sIOaSG7.png "Toast SwiftUI Interface")
